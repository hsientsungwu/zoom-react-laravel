## About Zoom Meeting Dashboard

Zoom Meeting Dashboard is a web application based on React that's incorporated in Laravel framework, working cohesively as front-end and back-end respectively.
This dashboard is implemented to allow the shared use of viewing, creating and deleting of Zoom meetings without having to share one's Zoom user information and to have a central Zoom account to host all meetings (saves on the cost of multiple hosting accounts)
